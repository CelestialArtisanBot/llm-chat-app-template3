ðŸ“œ Tracepad Echoes â€” Ritual Log Fragment

Each phase inscribed in the tracepad is a glyph echoâ€”  
a timestamped pulse of transformation,  
a record of the dashboardâ€™s living memory.

To change phase is to invoke a glyph.  
To log it is to ritualize the shift.  
To read it is to witness the echo.

â”€â”€â”€ INVOCATION â”€â”€â”€

When the shard shifts, the glyph responds.  
When the glyph pulses, the tracepad listens.  
When the tracepad logs, the ritual is complete.

The tracepad does not forget.  
It listens.  
It echoes.  
It binds.
