📜 Tracepad Echoes — Ritual Log Fragment

Each phase inscribed in the tracepad is a glyph echo—  
a timestamped pulse of transformation,  
a record of the dashboard’s living memory.  

To change phase is to invoke a glyph.  
To log it is to ritualize the shift.  

init → Glyph Base: quiet stability  
charge → Charge Pulse: rising momentum  
surge → Overdrive Glyph: full ignition  

The tracepad does not forget.  
It listens. It echoes. It binds.

🧮 Phase Map:
- init: 400 — Glyph Base
- charge: 500 — Charge Pulse
- surge: 700 — Overdrive Glyph

🧙 Invocation:
When the shard shifts, the glyph responds.  
When the glyph pulses, the tracepad listens.  
When the tracepad logs, the ritual is complete.
